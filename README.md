Project 3: Website Portfolio
Your task in this unit is to build a multi-page website using basic html and css files — as opposed to a site manager like WordPress or Wix — along with any media assets you wish to embed. (Any JavaScript or animation you want to add for interactivity is welcome, but above and beyond expectations.) In assigning this, I have two main goals for you:

to learn how to manage a composite project made up of multiple interlinking files, and
to explore the affordances of the web design stack as a medium, and especially its ability to flexibly render content for multiple audiences or reading priorities.
As with the earlier projects, the selection of content is your choice. One relatively straightforward option for this unit is to stage and present the materials you produced earlier in the term! Depending on your needs and interests, however, you can also develop this into a more sustainable and public-facing platform from which to manage your online identities, or a mock-up of demo content you can use to show off your web-design skills. Whatever you choose, you should consider your audience(s) and how they might land on your website, and where you therefore wish to direct their attention and next steps.

As you start planning your composition, consider: What have you been working on, in or out of this class, that you'd like to show the world? What have you made, or done, or pursued? If someone were to search for you without using your name, what terms would they use in the search? What images would represent or resonate with your answers so far? Or: if the site won't focus on you, what group, or thing, or event would you prefer to represent, and in how many ways could you tag or subdivide that?

See if any terms or images come to mind when you think of your subject, then work back and forth from image to word and back.

Generative constraints
To be updated after lesson 20

Baseline criteria For a minimum grade of B, all projects for this unit must:

Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus viewers' attention.
Use the reflection to clarify your compositional choices and goals (e.g. design hierarchy)
Include at least 3 navigable html locations (separate pages or distinct scrolling locations on the same page)
Include a sitewide css stylesheet (i.e. an organized visual theme)
Link internally from all pages (no dead ends)
Include at least one licensed or fair-use image, with alt text
Credit all assets correctly, including attribution (creator names) where required
Successfully load all elements in a web browser, at least locally
Use meaningful commit messages that say what’s changing (or even why)
Aspirational inspirations To target (but not guarantee) a grade above a B, the best projects for this unit may...

Dynamism

Use responsive design (e.g. @media queries, flex-wrap, auto-fill, etc) to dynamically resize elements based on viewport width
Animate HTML elements via JavaScript (e.g. image carousel) or CSS (e.g. @keyframes)
Add interactivity via JavaScript (e.g. on-click events / functions)
Coding

Validate your HTML
Use Flexbox or Grid layouts
Use classes shared across multiple elements to minimize repetition in your CSS
Use Jekyll (built into GitHub Pages; see Resources page) to minimize repetition in your HTML through templates and variables
Use CSS preprocessors (e.g. SASS, LESS) to minimize repetition in your stylesheets
Add comments, whitespace, and other formatting to code to make it more readable
Audience Engagement

Use non-default fonts, drawing on visual unit knowledge
Use best practices for accessible design (see W3's Four Principles and the WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool)
These include, but are not limited to, using semantic HTML elements like <section> instead of <div>
Use breadcrumbs or other cues to help readers locate themselves within the site, no matter where they begin
Optimize image filetypes, resolutions, and file sizes for faster loading
Load site publicly over the internet with GitHub Pages
Reflection

Refer to specific tutorials or reference materials that helped you in your design
Deadlines and products
At each stage, unless otherwise specified, upload (push) your materials to your own copy of this assignment repository. I recommend that you save often, using meaningful commit messages; for best results, please keep your filenames clear, lowercase, and space-free (use hyphens or underscores).

If you are using Box, please nevertheless share a link to your Box folder prominently in your GitHub repository.

Unless otherwise noted, materials are expected by 10pm on the following dates, so I can begin reviewing them before class the next day.

date	what's due	expected files
Tues Mar 11	Website Portfolio Proposal	Thinking in writing about what you'd like to do for this assignment.
Post to the appropriate Issue queue with your proposal, suggesting in prose the idea or appeal you're hoping to make. (And if you're stuck, see the "parachute prompts" below.)
NEW: Please include at least one photo of a design sketch, e.g. something hand-drawn to show possible layout.
In the same post, your readme, or a separate assets.md file, include a prospective assets chart (see Writer/Designer p. 149) naming what pages, page sections, and images you think you'll need.
Please also link to your repository in your post.
Tues Mar 23	Website Portfolio Preview 1: mobile-first content, minimal styling	An early snapshot of your progress, to get the gears turning. Turn in:
A multifile project folder – probably the pre-built folder named docs, for ease of use with GitHub Pages – containing a combination of HTML and CSS, even if it's not well-developed.
A static screenshot (.png or .jpg) of your website-in-progress, as rendered in a local web browser (for comparison later to subsequent drafts: this is your "flat" export).
A screenshot of your text editor setup, too, with the navigation pane showing: this can sometimes help me give feedback more quickly.)
At least an initial update to your README.md file, introducing your site (as opposed to this assignment). Feel free also to ask questions or lay out next steps for yourself!
An updated list of assets, now with any files or fonts you've actually obtained. As you go, add TASL documentation for any outside sources – title, author, source (e.g. url), and license (e.g. Creative Commons, fair use rationale).
Tues Mar 25	Second Preview: adding layout	An early attempt at laying out the content you had, e.g. for larger screens. This is still open to radical change. Turn in:
Another push of your project folder.
Another screenshot of your website and your workspace, showing what's new.
Optionally update your README with a description of what you were going for in the layout, and/or what you're hoping for help with.
Sun Mar 30	Website Portfolio Full Draft	A solid attempt at a complete website. Turn in:
A multifile project folder (probably docs), containing a combination of html and css files
At least one more static screenshot each of your rendered web pages and source code in progress.
Think about what moments are worth remembering as you go: where did you level up, or realize something, or get stuck?
An updated README.md file, introducing your site / source code to a new audience.
An updated list of assets, including TASL documentation.
Sun Apr 6 (target)	Website Portfolio Final Draft (target)	Include all the same components as in the earlier draft, but updated.
Mon Apr 7 by noon	Website Portfolio Reflection and Final Draft (firm)	Give a sense of the work you put into your website project and whether it accomplishes what you wanted it to. Turn in:
at least 500 words describing the work you did
at least two screenshots showing your work in progress
at least one screenshot of feedback that you responded to in revising (and please say how)
your own assessment of how you met the baseline criteria for the class, as well as aspirational criteria as appropriate
Post your reflections to the course site's Issue queue, to make it easier to embed images. (If you want to then copy the source code into a file in your repo called reflections.md, I won't stop you!)
A Note About Folders
If you look around in the default repo, you'll see that there are already a few subfolders created. These correspond to the folders that you'll be asked to make in the html/css tutorial I'm assigning for homework, and are my suggested way of organizing your space as you make your way through the exercises there.

Note, though, that you will have to create at least one more folder even in the first homework (for the fourth tutorial, "Hello, CSS"). And, presumably, many more (the tutorial has 14 chapters, though not all of them are assigned). You can create these new folders directly in VS Code or Pulsar by right-clicking in the empty space of the sidebar where the other folders already exist. (Other text editors probably have similar affordances.)

Parachute Prompts
If you find yourself coming up on proposal day and you're not sure what to propose, try one of these:

Showcase your classwork. Make a landing page that links to a second page containing your audio narrative and a third page containing your visual argument. Work with semantic HTML to make the media files directly accessible to site visitors (i.e. they shouldn't need to download them). As an EXT, you might want to showcase work you've produced for other courses, in which case I encourage you to look for (and write about) a learning trajectory or set of insights that tie your courses together.

Site redesign. Choose an existing website that you think is kinda boring, or busy, or otherwise in need of a fresh start.a After thinking about why someone would be coming to the site, and what they might want to do once there, build a mock-up of a new design that better meets those needs and goals. NB: I say "mock-up" advisedly: many live sites on the open web can be fiendishly complicated. While it's a good idea to "View Page Source" to look at the underlying html, you may prefer to create your own simplified version from scratch, with just the major block elements you'll use for layout and navigation, and write your stylesheet just for that.

a A few sites I'm involved with that I know could use a redesign (but I haven't had time) are the Writing About Writing Standing Group (WAW-SG) of the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC), and the Writing Studies Tree (an academic genealogy site), not to mention our very own Composing Digital Media. And there's always the CSS Zen Garden...
Build a customer experience. Make a public-facing site (or template) for a brick-and-mortar store or service, whether real or imagined. Think about what customers would need to know immediately and what additional questions they might ask or details you might provide. NB: No actual purchasing functionality is expected, and would for sure be aspirational (and would also probably require setting up a secure database or plugging into an external service).

Electrate Autobiography. My colleague Stephen Quigley has put together a guided exercise in reflecting on your networks of influence that functions as a kind of behind-the-scenes hands-on-code version of an Adobe Spark. Template-style writing prompts are hidden in comments on the html, and the CSS is fully customizable. Have a look at https://github.com/Pitt-Fuego/Electrate-Fuego#readme for more information!

NB: These templates assume you don't already have a GitHub account or repository to work in. No worries: when you get to the step on downloading the .zip, you can uncompress the files into your website repo for this class instead of starting from scratch.
And if your parachute is malfunctioning (i.e. you'd like even more specific direction), just let me know! I'm happy to talk things out in office hours.
